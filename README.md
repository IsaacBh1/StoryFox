   - Navigate to the `Server` folder in your project.
   - Create a `.env` file (if it doesn't already exist).
   - Add the `GEMINI_API_KEY` to the `.env` file:
     ```properties
     GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
     ```
   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key.

   2. **Restart the Server**:

   ```

   3. **Set the Axios Base URL in the Agent File**:

   - Open the `agent.ts` file located in the `Client/api` folder.
   - Update the `baseURL` in the `axios.create` configuration to the public URL generated by ngrok:
     ```typescript
     const api = axios.create({
       baseURL: "https://<your-ngrok-url>.ngrok.io", // Replace with your ngrok public URL
     });
     ```
   - Replace `<your-ngrok-url>` with the actual public URL generated by ngrok.

4. **Run the app**

   # In a new terminal
   ngrok http 3000 # or the port your server is running on
